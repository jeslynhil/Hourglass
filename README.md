# Hourglass

Hourglass just like its name, is a prototype for an app that revolves around the time management of its users. The applucation will feature compatibilty with others on the device such as social media platforms -- where once clicking on an app, a timer will appear with an hourglass icon accrording to the running time of opening the app. Users will be able to customise features such as wanted apps to be utilised, limits, loops, and aesthetics such as colour choice. This prototype was developed according to personal experinces.
